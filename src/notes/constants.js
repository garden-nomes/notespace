##### This is a simple little app for creating graphs of connected notes (think like mind maps).
***
To get started, hit *edit* at the top of this page to edit this note or *double click* on the graph to create a new note. *Shift-click* another note to connect them.

Notes will be saved in your browser's local storage, so don't worry -- you can close this tab and come back to it later if you want to take a nap.

Hope it's useful! üëç`;

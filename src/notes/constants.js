This is a simple little app for creating graphs of connected notes (think like mind maps). To get started, hit "edit" at the top of this page to edit a note or double click somewhere on the graph to create a new note. Shift-click another note to connect them. Notes will be saved in your browser's local storage, so they should persist after a page refresh (but note between browers).

Hope it's useful!

##### This is a simple little app for creating graphs of connected notes (think like mind maps).
***
To get started, hit "edit" at the top of this page to edit this note or double click somewhere on the graph to create a new note. Shift-click another note to connect them.

Notes will be saved in your browser's local storage, so don't worry -- you can close this tab and come back to it later if you need a nap.

Hope it's useful! üëç`;

# notespace

Try it out at https://noaner.github.io/notespace!

This is a simple little single-page React app for taking notes in a graph-based
format (think mind mapping). Created to learn React, but I think it's actually
a pretty neat little app ðŸ˜‰.

Uses React, Redux, Bootstrap 4, and [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) for graph
rendering.

## run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noaner/notespace
cd notespace
npm install
npm start
```
